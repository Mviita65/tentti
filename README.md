# tentti
Full stack learning with React, JavaScript, Node.js, PostGreSQL and finally deployed with Heroku cloud platform. 
This was my own rehearsal and for a while, before actual intership I was developping a better one with more features together with my classmate 
both ones are still not completed. My own application can be tested here https://tenttimv.herokuapp.com/
