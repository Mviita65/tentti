Full stack learning with React, JavaScript, Node.js, PostGreSQL and finally deployed with Heroku cloud platform. 

The idea is to carry out exams and to make new exams and questions for the exams, update exams and questions, 
remove exam from course and remove question from exam. Before doing the before mentioned actions one must register or sign in if one has already registered. 
Used language (Finnish or English) depens on the language used in browser.

This was my own rehearsal and for a while, before actual intership demanded to complete the full stack developer course I was developing a better one 
with more features together with my classmate.
